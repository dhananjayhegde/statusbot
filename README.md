# Node.js app for Recast.ai bot to connect to SAP Cloud Platform

This is only a beginning.  Lot of things yet to be done.

Idea is to connect `Recast.ai` bot to SAP On Premise systems through SAP Cloud Platform.
In this, biggest challenge is to be able to connect to a `Node.js` app on the `SAP CP (Cloud Platform)`. 
This app tries to solve that problem.

## Usage

App itself is hosted on SAP Cloud Platform Trial using Cloud Foundry.  
Clone the repo into your a folder and then run 
-	`node init`
-	`npm install express --save`

This will initiate the node app
